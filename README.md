## 🌟 Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design**: Adjusting layout across devices required detailed Tailwind tweaking.
- **State Management**: Managing UI behavior using `useState` while keeping components reusable.
- **Deployment**: Configuring Vercel and updating GitHub repo for seamless deployment.
- **Navigation**: Implementing smooth scrolling without React Router.
